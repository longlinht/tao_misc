There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.

The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.

People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.

So many people say, “Oh, I’m not interested in money.” Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day.

It’s not how much money you make. It’s how much money you keep.

Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets.

An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket.


Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.

A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate.

The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.

 Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else.

Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities.

My rich dad just played the game smart, and he did it through corporations—the biggest secret of the rich.

My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.

If you work for money, you give the power to you employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.




Each dollar in my asset column was a great employee, working hard to make more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche.

Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.


Games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback systems.



The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth.

The problem with “secure” investments is that they are often sanitized, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.


It is not gambling if you know what you’re doing. It is gambling if you’re just throwing money into a deal and praying.




Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind.

Job security meant everything to my educated dad. Learning meant everything to my rich dad.



“You want to know a little about a lot” was rich dad’s suggestion.

Job is an acronym for “Just Over Broke.”

The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear.


For most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.

Failure inspires winners. Failure defeats losers.


Rich dad believed that the words “I can’t afford it” shut down your brain. “How can I afford it?” opens up possibilities, excitement, and dreams.


There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.

The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I get my money back?”
