Through thick and thin
No peeking
I'll walk you out
Don't mind him
I'll get out of your hair
Don't put words in my mouth
Fine with me
I'll leave you two
It just came out
Fill me in
Your name came up
How come
You're burning up
Don't freak out
Forget I asked
Shot in the dark
The cat's out of the bag
Slipped my mind
Not on your life
Knock yourself out
Don't blow it
Knock it off
Perfect timing
Deal with it
Let me put it this way
Out of the blue
Come again
Rise and shine
Potato, potato
Not another word
Dinner's on
Lights out
Water under the bridge
I'm just saying
Get real
Safe and sound
Let me rephrase that
Humor me
Go away
Don't beat around the bush
Your are pulling my leg
If I were in your shoes
Think nothing of it
I hear you
High five
Return the favor
I don't want to be a bother
Bottoms up
Wrap it up
Let me get this straight
Good call
This is too much
Nice digs
Circle back
I have faith in you
What have you been up to
How did it go
Talk to the hand
It's a long story
I couldn't care less
I got your back
Easy does it
Get the picture
I get it
What should I do














































are you sure this is what you want?

I can't go on **sneaking around**, **grabbing moments with you** in hotel rooms and dark bars.

I'm in love with you.

Well, you've been saying that.

I just don't wanna feel as thought I've **broken up** your marriage.

Let's all **take a breath**.

We can **get in each othter's faces** and see who's the toughest.

I'm gonna **prance myself right out on a limb**, and guess that no one's ever accused you of being a **people person**.

how about you take these cuffs off and you find out yourself

Maybe that has changed too, though.

I paid millions of dollars for this building's security.

You got your money's worth.
