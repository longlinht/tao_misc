you're kidding

a flood of 

walking out on

runway show

plaything

why write to the death

be no stranger to sth

Rememberance Day

scatter

toast of the town

stalk

stutter

half the time = very often

shitty grades

gala

we've talking things out

a walking dictionary

dental floss

person belongings

ticket booth

be obsessed with

mustardy yellow

blush

our actions speak louder then words

Be careful what you wish for

my jaw was on the floor

set out to do sth

rip off

strike out on one's own

childhood trauma

emotional trauma

it is on sb 归咎于某人

Princeton is like 5 hours away by train

at this juncture 在此关键时刻

be supposed to 本该

that is how that supposed to

sho sb. in a good light 使人展现出好形象

where are you off to?

not since yesterday


Through thick and thin

No peeking

I'll walk you out

Don't mind him

I'll get out of your hair

Don't put words in my mouth

Fine with me

I'll leave you two

It just came out

Fill me in

Your name came up

How come

You're burning up

Don't freak out

Forget I asked

Shot in the dark

The cat's out of the bag

Slipped my mind

Not on your life

Knock yourself out

Don't blow it

Knock it off

Perfect timing

Deal with it

Let me put it this way

Out of the blue

Come again

Rise and shine

Potato, potato

Not another word

Dinner's on

Lights out

Water under the bridge

I'm just saying

Get real

Safe and sound

Let me rephrase that

Humor me

Go away

Don't beat around the bush

Your are pulling my leg

If I were in your shoes

Think nothing of it

I hear you

High five

Return the favor

I don't want to be a bother

Bottoms up

Wrap it up

Let me get this straight

Good call

This is too much

Nice digs

Circle back

I have faith in you

What have you been up to

How did it go

Talk to the hand

It's a long story

I couldn't care less

I got your back

Easy does it

Get the picture

I get it

What should I do






































are you sure this is what you want?

I can't go on **sneaking around**, **grabbing moments with you** in hotel rooms and dark bars.

I'm in love with you.

Well, you've been saying that.

I just don't wanna feel as thought I've **broken up** your marriage.

Let's all **take a breath**.

We can **get in each othter's faces** and see who's the toughest.

I'm gonna **prance myself right out on a limb**, and guess that no one's ever accused you of being a **people person**.

how about you take these cuffs off and you find out yourself

Maybe that has changed too, though.

I paid millions of dollars for this building's security.

You got your money's worth.
