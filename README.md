are you sure this is what you want?

I can't go on sneaking around, grabbing moments with you in hotel rooms and dark bars.

I'm in love with you.

Well, you've been saying that.

I just don't wanna feel as thought I've broken up your marriage.

Let's all take a breath.

We can get in each othter's faces and see who's the toughest.
