are you sure this is what you want?

I can't go on **sneaking around**, **grabbing moments with you** in hotel rooms and dark bars.

Well, you've been saying that.

I just don't wanna feel as thought I've **broken up** your marriage.

Let's all **take a breath**.

We can **get in each othter's faces** and see who's the toughest.

I'm gonna **prance myself right out on a limb**, and guess that no one's ever accused you of being a **people person**.

how about you take these cuffs off and you find out yourself

I paid millions of dollars for this building's security.

You got your money's worth.
